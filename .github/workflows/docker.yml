# GitHub actions workflow which builds and publishes the docker images. Four images can come from this run
# 1. A latest image which is based on an actual release, also tagged with version number in format 'v*.*.*'
# 2. A prerelease image which is based on release candidates. This is only tagged with a version, 'v*.*.*'
# 3. A nightly image, which is based on the develop branch and is cut at 1 UTC which is about 8pm in my timezone
# 4. A custom image, sourced from a remote repository. Give the workflow a custom repo in the format 'owner/repo'
#       and a branch in the format 'custom-branch' and an image will be built and uploaded with the custom branch
#       name as it's tag. Do not use characters in your branch name that are not docker tag approved, or the build
#       will fail. Hyphens are ok, underscores and either slashes are not.
# All are automated builds, by checking the matrix-org repo once a day and if a new release is found building
# the image, or in the case of nightly just building it every night, even weekends(sometimes things get committed
# then too).

# Added 2023.03.16: Push to GHCR.io registry as well. According to:
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-docker-images#publishing-images-to-docker-hub-and-github-packages
# it is as simple as logging into both dockerhub and ghcr.io and then updating the tags to reference both places. It's unclear
# if the image to go to dockerhub should be prefixed with 'docker.io' or not. Write permissions active for 'packages' is an
# important detail.
# Added 2023.07.08: Build from custom repo and branch
#   Mutated the unified dockerfile to remove the $FROM ARG and use build-contexts instead, which allows overriding
#   the image pulled from the outside. Added in a a local registry to store the intermediate image built, as the
#   local docker store won't allow access to built images directly(some kind of security issue?). Information came from:
#   https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/named-contexts and the normal docs for docker buildx.
#   Also went ahead and reformatted this file and fixed some loose conditions.

# We rebuild Release, Pre-Release and Nightly if there is a human change(push) to the master branch. Earlier in the day, a different
# workflow will make updates to the release files and commit those changes. These changes are not detected here. A later scheduled
# run will check for these changes and build appropriate images. In the case of Nightly, it will be built every night.

# The conditions to look for are:
# schedule:
#   release: steps.changes.outputs.release == true
#   prelease: steps.changes.outputs.prerelease == true
#   nightly: github.event_name == 'schedule'
#
# push: always rebuild all images
# workflow_dispatch: always rebuild all images if master branch is chosen
